# Project Template
Team Members: 

This document is intended to keep track of setup information or other details needed to use this notebook.

If you use external sources to obtain data or install packages in unusual ways, it'd be useful to write about it here.

Typically, this is also where a software license lives. Right now, your code is private to your team; if you choose to show this publicly in the future, I encourage you to pick an appropriate open-source license for your project.
